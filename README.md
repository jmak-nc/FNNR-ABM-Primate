# FNNR-Primate-ABM

To run the code, access the ABM file and download its contents.
Also have the Mesa library for Python instead, and any dependencies, such as pandas or tornado.
Then run 'server.py'.

Please note that the chart module, # of agents slider, and some land parameters are not working.
However, the agents otherwise move according to a weighted (by suitability, as determined by land color) formula.
