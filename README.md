# FNNR-Primate-ABM

1. Have Python 3.X installed, as well as the Mesa (which comes with dependencies such as numpy, pandas, and tornado) and matplotlib libraries.
If you have errors running the code and it is library-related, make sure Mesa's edition is 0.8.3, and tornado's edition is 4.5.2.

2. Download the code. Files are found in the ABM folder.

3a. Run 'server.py' to launch a web browser with an interactive visualization module of monkey movement.
Monkey movements are semi-randomized, and based on the weighted value of their 8-neighbor surroundings.
This weighted value is currently determined by elevation (changeable in code; requires a raster layer converted to an ASCII file).

3b. Run 'graph.py' to see population demographic charts after 1 year, or 73 time-steps (changeable in code).

This project is incomplete.
