---Version History---
8/8 - Updated code comments
8/9 - Updated User Manual; uploaded some data (Excel files used for kappa analysis)
***7/16 note: this is extremely outdated. I will update this and the rest of my documentation after my thesis has been sent to the committee, hopefully between July 30th and August 13th.
7/16 - Code's handling of heatmaps finalized. Code runs on my computers but not advisor's.
7/14 - Humans and resource gathering integrated into the code.
7/12 - Resources integrated into the code; human agents in testing.
7/9 - Working on integrating resources and human collectors into the code. This is mostly Excel and ArcMap work.
7/5 - Household layers imported. Need to adjust agent movement now.
7/2 - Need to update this for month of June. Imported vegetation and refined movement. previous update refined movement as well, but for elevation grid. more work done in ArcMap
6/7 - Updated Maxent suitability analysis, adjusted visualization to handle different grid sizes, erased gridlines
- 6/1, 6/4 to be updated -
5/28 - Expect to finish more pseudocore (sections 8-10)
5/25 - Minor bug fixes to the population structure model over the long term. Most work done today was in ArcGIS, preparing layers for Maxent.
5/22 - Monkey demographic structure/population model set up--now runs through either server.py or graph.py. # of (family) agents slider fixed; will add more eventually. Some code cleanup.
5/14 and before - Path algorithm for monkey movement (8-grid neighbor choice according to elevation's assigned weight) works. # of agents slider broken. Some unused code shells to clean up.
