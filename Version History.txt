---Version History---
7/2 - need to update this. imported vegetation and refined movement. previous update refined movement as well, but for elevation grid. more work done in ArcMap
6/7 - Updated Maxent suitability analysis, adjusted visualization to handle different grid sizes, erased gridlines
- 6/1, 6/4 to be updated -
5/28 - Expect to finish more pseudocore (sections 8-10)
5/25 - Minor bug fixes to the population structure model over the long term. Most work done today was in ArcGIS, preparing layers for Maxent.
5/22 - Monkey demographic structure/population model set up--now runs through either server.py or graph.py. # of (family) agents slider fixed; will add more eventually. Some code cleanup.
5/14 and before - Path algorithm for monkey movement (8-grid neighbor choice according to elevation's assigned weight) works. # of agents slider broken. Some unused code shells to clean up.
